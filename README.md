SERVERLESS IOT DATA PROCESSING
          These are the instructions explains how to set up and operate your smart home, monitor data, and understand project dependencies. Our project employs serverless architecture and leverages IBM Cloud services to transform your home into an efficient, secure, and smart living space.

Prerequisites:
           Before embarking on your smart home journey, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

IBM Cloud Account: Create an IBM Cloud account here.
Smart Devices: Acquire smart devices such as thermostats, motion sensors, and cameras that are compatible with your chosen IoT platform.
Development Tools: Install Node.js and npm for serverless function development, and Python for using the IBM Cloud SDK.
Internet Connectivity: Ensure a stable internet connection to facilitate communication between devices.
Getting Started
Kickstart your smart home project with the following steps:

Device Integration: Begin by identifying and integrating your smart devices into the smart home ecosystem. Verify compatibility and connect them to your home Wi-Fi network.

Data Collection: Configure your smart devices to transmit data to the IoT platform of your choice. Ensure that data transmission is functioning correctly.

IBM Cloud Functions Setup: Create a namespace within IBM Cloud Functions tailored to your project's requirements. Develop serverless functions that handle real-time data processing and automation based on data from your smart devices.

Automation Routines: Create automation routines designed to enhance energy efficiency and home security. Utilize conditional statements within your serverless functions to govern device behavior.

Data Storage: Establish IBM Cloud Object Storage for the secure and efficient storage of data generated by your smart devices. Define a data structure and organization method that aligns with your project's objectives.

Operating Your Smart Home
Operating your smart home is a straightforward process:

Ensure that your smart devices are correctly set up and connected to your IoT platform.
